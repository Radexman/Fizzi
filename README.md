# 🥤 Fizzi — Prebiotic Soda Product Showcase

**Live Demo:** [https://fizzi-radexman.vercel.app/](https://fizzi-radexman.vercel.app/)

Fizzi is a **fake product showcase** app for a prebiotic soda brand, built using modern web technologies to demonstrate the integration of 3D experiences with content management systems. It leverages the power of **Next.js**, **Prismic**, and **Three.js** to create a visually rich, animated, and content-driven product landing page.

> This project was developed following the excellent [Prismic YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKQqrNyAC6k&t=16054s), which deepened my understanding of 3D interactive experiences using tools like `@react-three/fiber`, `drei`, and `gsap`.
